# feat: Add FancyNormLayer to MyDeepNet
# what: Implement a normalization layer presented in [http:~].
# why: This layer would work better than the current norm layers.
# * Potentially improves classfication accuracy by normalizing input to
#   each convolution layers.
# * The paper also reports that the layer would contribute to faster
#   convergence with proper hyper parameter of the norm layers.
# * As side effect, the performance may get unstable if mini batch size
#   is small.
